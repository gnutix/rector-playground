# Rector Playground

### How to play with it

1. Clone the repository (and ensure you have PHP on your machine)
2. Execute `./scripts/SETUP` (to install the vendors)
3. Execute `./scripts/RUN` (to execute the playground checks)

You can also execute Rector through Docker using `./scripts/RUN_IN_DOCKER`.
